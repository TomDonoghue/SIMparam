# Notebooks

Welcome to the FOOOF simulation test notebooks!


This set of notebooks steps through simulating power spectra, and testing FOOOF, under various conditions.

### 00-SimulationsSetup

This notebook sets up how the simulations work, and introduces the simulation settings.

### 01-OnePeakSims

This notebook explores how FOOOF performs on simulations with one peak.

### 02-MultiPeakSims

This notebook explores how FOOOF performs on simulations with multiple peak.

### 03-ModelViolations-Periodic

This notebook explores how FOOOF deals with simulated spectra that violate model assumptions, in periodic properties.

### 04-ModelViolations-Aperiodic

This notebook explores how FOOOF deals with simulated spectra that violate model assumptions, in aperiodic properties.
