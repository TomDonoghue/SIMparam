# Notebooks

Welcome to the FOOOF simulation test notebooks!

This set of notebooks steps through simulating power spectra, and testing FOOOF, under various conditions.

### 00-SimulationsSetup

This notebook sets up how the simulations work, and introduces the simulation settings.

### 01-OnePeakSims

This notebook explores how FOOOF performs on simulations with one peak.

### 02-MultiPeakSims

This notebook explores how FOOOF performs on simulations with multiple peaks.

### 03-KneeSims

This notebook explores how FOOOF performs on simulations with a knee (a bend in the aperiodic component).

### 04-ModelViolations-Aperiodic

This notebook explores how FOOOF deals with simulated spectra that violate model assumptions, in aperiodic properties. It examines what happens if spectra with a knee are fit without a knee.

### 05-ModelViolations-PeriodicI

This notebook explores how FOOOF deals with simulated spectra that violate model assumptions, in periodic properties. It examines fitting spectra with asymmetric peaks in the frequency domain.

### 06-ModelViolations-PeriodicII

This notebook explores how FOOOF deals with simulated spectra that violate model assumptions, in periodic properties. It examines fitting spectra from time series with asymmetric properties, that generate harmonics in the frequency domain.

### 07-Comparisons-BOSC

This notebook compares FOOOF to another related method - BOSC.
It compares measuring aperiodic activity, as done by BOSC, compared to how it is done by FOOOF.

### 08-Comparisons-IRASA

This notebook compares FOOOF to another related method - IRASA.
It compares measuring aperiodic activity, as done by IRASA, compared to how it is done by FOOOF.
